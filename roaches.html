<p>as of 01/02/26, i have a starter colony of <b>gromphadorhina portentosa</b>. i've started out with 1 male, 2 females, and 2 nymphs. (these are hybrids and not pure, i assume they are mixed with <b>gromphadorhina grandidieri.</b>)</p>
<p> this setup is in a 6-7 gallon (~9x16x10.5in). substrate is zoomed brand "tropical bioblend" that includes cocofiber, sphagnum moss and a 'reptisoil' base. there is cork bark logs and dried oak leaf litter. </p>
<p>01/02/26 this is my first time owning a male. he's much more active than the females as expected. he's also aggressive and tends to bully the others. he's interesting to observe since the females prefer to hide and relax. one of the females is assumed to be pregnant, but the other seems to have a minor prolapse and cannot breed.</p>
<p>07/02/26 i finally managed to keep the humidity stable. at first i tried aluminum foil all over the lid, but it only kept the heat up. someone recommended packing tape to me, so i've added that instead, and the heat problem seemed to be fixed. what i had to do for the humidity was pour water into the corners of the substrate, and the humidity has been in the 70s for a good couple hours. :)</p>
